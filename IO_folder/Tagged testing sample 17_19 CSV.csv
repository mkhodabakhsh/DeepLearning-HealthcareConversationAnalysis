I'm sorry what.",0,0,0,0
61,"Well,
I know,
you know, your congestive heart failure is sound.",0,0,0,0
62,The good news is it sounds like it's stable.,0,0,0,0
63,So from that perspective.,0,0,0,0
64,"There isn't any contra indication or reason, you know, there isn't any medical reason that that someone was stable CHF couldn't wear a mask so we couldn't say that you can't wear a basket for that reason.",0,0,0,0
65,"But I do hear that, you know, your feeling may be having, you know the mask wearing is uncomfortable for you and.",0,0,0,1
66,"And I hear I hear that subjectively and I, I understand that.",0,0,0,0
67,"So I think we can state, a letter is such, and if they feel that there's more.",0,0,0,0
68,"They may feel like and this is up to the HR they may feel like you might need more of a
mental health evaluation or something else if they feel like they, you know, are you know if it's going to be, you know, related related to something like that that says that you know that that for from that perspective, can't wear a mask.",0,0,0,0
69,"
But it does.",0,0,0,0
70,"
I mean I hear like I'm really glad to hear that they, you know, sounds like they've significantly changed your
work,
expectations, you know, because I know that you told me you had to carry things up and down the stairs so I'm really happy to hear that they don't have you doing that wearing a mask.",0,0,0,1
71,But I think.,0,0,0,0
72,"
But Bernie I help her
clear.",0,0,0,0
73,"Like I said, I won't be able to write a blanket statement saying you can't wear a mask you're from a medical perspective, your medical conditions are currently stable so that it doesn't preclude us I can't, I can't as a licensed as a licensed professional in California, you know, right, that, that you can't medically wear a mask.",0,0,0,0
74,"So what I can do is just make some recommendations I believe the symptoms that you're having, so they may make a decision that if they think that it's mental health related that they'll require that you have more formal more formal evaluation for that to determine whether you know that falls into the category of, you know, absolving you from wearing a mask and significantly changing your work or having you go on disability, but we I would defer to a professional to make a mental health professional to make that decision.",0,0,0,0
75,"
I will write you a letter, just in effect I think to clarify your concerns around wearing a mask that I cannot write you a letter that says from your congestive heart failure perspective that you can't wear a mask.",0,0,0,0
76,"I can't honestly, I can't honestly write that.",0,0,0,0

81,"
I see.",0,0,0,0
82,"
Yeah, I mean, yeah,
I think that I can give some guidelines in terms of limiting the amount of stairs, but if if they're going to need a formal evaluation in terms of strict limits on how many stairs, you can climb, how far you can walk.",0,0,0,0
83,"That's when it gets into the category of a disability evaluation and that's when they would need you to see a disability, someone, someone specialized in doing a disability evaluation.",0,0,0,0
84,"
We don't do that in our office.",0,0,0,0
85,"If you can understand Bernie is pretty set it's, there's a lot of conflict of interest.",0,0,0,0
86,"So, you know, I just want to be honest in,
you know, in the letters that are right I think you can respect to that or wanting to be honest and, you know, in, you know, giving my professional recommendation, like as your doctor I want to help you and support you where I can you know as I can.",0,0,0,0
87,"But I also have to be honest in, you know, in making a clinical recommendation.",0,0,0,0
88,"
I believe that you're, I believe that you feel that he can't, that you feel you feel uncomfortable breathing.",0,0,0,0
89,"And again, I'm happy
to write a letter
along this line, I cannot write, honestly, that because of a clinical or medicine, you know, a clinical condition related to your
congestive heart failure that you can't wear a mask.",0,0,0,0
90,"I don't, I don't feel.",0,0,0,0
91,"I don't feel writing, I don't feel comfortable, writing that letter.",0,0,0,0
92,"
I don't feel comfortable I don't feel it I'd be honest in writing that letter and signing my name to that
which.",0,0,0,0
93,"Okay, how about I will send you a letter and you can decide if you want to forward that to HR.",0,0,0,0
94,"I think that you will, if it's not what you're looking for, you'll probably need to talk with HR about seeking the seeking of disability physician.",0,0,0,0
95,So someone who would do very.,0,0,0,0
96,"There's formal paperwork and everything so we'll take you through a detailed step process about what you can do what you can't do you know maybe breathing assessments maybe mental health assessment mental health assessment for the difficulty breathing that you're experiencing I'm sorry that you're here and you have that and I'm sorry that you know your work situation is, is what it is.",0,0,0,0
97,"And again I, you know, I want to make sure I want to be here to support you and make sure that you know your health is, you know, as good as it can be.",0,0,0,0
98,"And you know, and I'll tell you and I'll be honest with you with what you know.",0,0,0,0
99,"You know, I hope you appreciate I'm being honest about what I feel comfortable writing for you.",0,0,0,0
100,"
Mr. T have anything else to add.",0,0,0,0
101,"Yeah, I would at this point I would like you to find a physician.",0,0,0,0
102,There are special.,0,0,0,0
103,"There are physicians who specifically are licensed and trained to do disability
evaluations.",0,0,0,0
104,"So you would need to find one of those physicians to do that and HR should be
able to, to give you a list of names.",0,0,0,0
105,If you can think of it it's a specialized field within medicine.,0,0,0,0
106,I don't know I would like I said I would start with.,0,0,0,0
107,"I would start with HR for list
of who they recommended because I mean they have obviously they would have had plenty of other workers that have gone through disability evaluation.",0,0,0,0
108,"So they may have it, they may have occupational and occupational health person, and list of occupational health and disability, physicians that you can contact for the disability paperwork and evaluation.",0,0,0,0
109,"
Well,
you're welcome and Bernie I mean I just gonna say clinically I do I know you've I've messaged you about this I know you don't feel comfortable now but I do recommend that you do get bloodwork every six months that's the safest thing to do because you're on the water pill, it can impact your potassium levels and your kidney function.",0,0,0,0
110,"So, you know, again I just want to make sure you get the best care possible.",0,0,0,0
111,"So I do think I just, I will stress that again I think you are, you are due for your six month bloodwork and I do recommend getting that done.",0,0,0,0
112,Okay.,0,0,0,0
113,Okay.,0,0,0,0
114,All right.,0,0,0,0
115,Thanks Bernie.,0,0,0,0

Okay.",0,0,0,0
117,Take care.,0,0,0,0
118,Bye bye.,0,0,0,0
119,"
few other questions.",0,0,0,0
120,Have you tried any therapy or what what what therapy Have you done in the past for this.,1,0,0,0
121,"
Sorry, tell me again.",0,0,0,0
122,"Okay, okay.",0,0,0,0
123,"
When did you last do therapy or what did you do therapy specific to talk about anxiety.",1,0,0,0
124,Okay.,0,0,0,0
125,And When's the last time you went through therapy.,1,0,0,0
126,Two years ago.,1,0,0,0
127,Okay.,0,0,0,0
128,Did you find therapy to be helpful.,0,1,0,0
129,Okay.,0,0,0,0
130,"
Okay,
that sounds traumatic.",0,0,0,1
131,"
Sure.",0,0,0,0
132,Yeah.,0,0,0,0
133,Okay.,0,0,0,0
134,And then what about medications you shared the CBD is CBD but have you done any prescription medications like Zoloft or.,0,1,0,0
135,"
Okay, got it.",0,0,0,0
136,"Well, what do you think what would you like to do.",1,0,0,0
137,Now Mike glad.,0,0,0,0
138,Okay.,0,0,0,0
139,"
Got it.",0,0,0,0
140,Did your therapist also recommend medication.,0,1,0,0
141,Do they provide any guidance.,0,1,0,0
142,No.,0,0,0,0
143,Okay.,0,0,0,0
144,"
Got it, like that's the therapeutic part is actually just writing it and sending it out.",0,0,0,1
145,Yeah.,0,0,0,0
146,Got it.,0,0,0,0
147,Okay.,0,0,0,0
148,"And then, Michael what medications are you currently taking now let me just review that.",1,0,0,0
149,"Okay, got it and I saw you just had a visit today.",0,0,0,0
150,Sounds like it sounds like everything's in place which is good.,0,0,0,1
151,Yeah.,0,0,0,0
152,"
I'll get no problems like.",0,0,0,0
153,Okay.,0,0,0,0
154,"
Okay.",0,0,0,0
155,Sounds good.,0,0,0,0
156,"
Well you know what, you're not alone, there are many I treat a lot of anxiety and depression, it is so so so common so it's great that you've made this step, you have good awareness and you're also, you know, you know obviously as you know there's lots of stigma around mental health so that's why people delay getting help or seeking help so I'm so glad to see that you feel comfortable talking about it you're really open to, you know, to get better.",0,0,1,0
157,"So, yeah, I mean, I think, you know, there's a couple of thoughts which is, you could reconsider doing kind of what I call counseling with a professional licensed therapist I don't know that the seven cups, is a therapist or a coach but they, you know, there's definitely value to someone who's licensed to do cognitive behavioral therapy, and you definitely want to find someone that you are going to connect with not someone that you feel you know is not affirming like your previous experience.",0,0,0,0
158,"And then like, yeah, so there's that and then the other option is medications which you brought up.",0,0,0,0
159,"You know, I think there's no one right way to trigger, you know when to start.",0,0,0,0
160,Definitely you don't fall into this severe category just by the screening questions how you responded on the screening questions.,0,0,0,0
161,"That being said, that doesn't mean you wouldn't benefit from, you know, a trial of medications if you want to do that so I usually defer to patients, you know, it really we take a very personalized approach, it's what you're comfortable with what you want to try.",0,0,0,0
162,Okay.,0,0,0,0
163,Okay.,0,0,0,0
164,Yeah.,0,0,0,0
165,Okay.,0,0,0,0
166,"
Got it.",0,0,0,0
167,Yeah.,0,0,0,0
168,"
Yeah, I think these are my thoughts if you know your insurance is going to switch.",0,0,0,0
169,Most all insurances are required to have to have mental health coverage.,0,0,0,0
170,"Now that being said, a lot of insurance companies will work through optumhealth.",0,0,0,0
171,"I don't know in the East Coast if you end up getting insurance coverage that's in the East Coast, it may be different but often is pretty national.",0,0,0,0
172,Okay.,0,0,0,0
173,"And so, if, if the provider participates that often most likely you'll be they'll be able to follow you through the insurance switch.",0,0,0,0
174,"Okay, so there's that consideration.",0,0,0,0
175,So what you'll want to do if you want to try to find a virtual therapist a lot of therapists now are going virtual because of COVID so it's great because then you should be able to continue to follow them.,0,0,0,0
176,"Although that being said, with tele there's now telehealth rules, it's relaxed in COVID, it may change, where you have to be licensed in the state that the patient is physically located.",0,0,0,0
177,"So that means that you might if you're going to reside in New York, most of the time you might want to find a therapist, that's virtually available in New York.",0,0,0,0
178,Okay.,0,0,0,0
179,So there's that.,0,0,0,0
180,"And then in terms of medication that's no problem as long as you out, it can put you on a generic medication that's going to get covered, regardless of any insurance plan that you have.",0,0,0,0
181,"
I don't know it just depends on the trigger when you want to pull the trigger for medications I'm kind of hearing you're leaning towards that and wanting to try something that's that's a sense of getting from what you're sharing with me.",0,0,0,1
182,Sure.,0,0,0,0
183,"
Yeah, well let me talk about the other option there's two options.",0,0,0,0
184,"There's one, a medication that you kind of just take as needed, particularly if you're having more what feels like panic attacks or just, you know, you know, periods where you're feeling anxious and you just need something to help you relax versus taking something that you have on a daily basis, which will overall kind of smooth things over right so you don't just take it as needed you would take it every day.",0,0,0,0
185,I don't know which one feels like a better fit for you and I will say the one that you take just as needed.,0,0,0,0
186,"One of the major side effects is drowsiness, so that's just something to be aware of you may get used to it over time.",0,0,0,0
187,"
Okay.",0,0,0,0
188,"
Okay.",0,0,0,0
189,"Yeah, that sounds good.",0,0,0,0
190,"Yep, and you can what you'll do, I will give you the name of the medication that you can consider.",0,0,0,0
191,And there's one I'm looking at we're just looking to see if it's generic yet.,0,0,0,0
192,Hold on a second.,0,0,0,0
193,"
There is a medication called.",0,0,0,0
194,It's called an ad to miksa teen I don't prescribe this as much but it's really good for adults who have ADHD and generalized anxiety.,0,0,0,0
195,"And it looks like it's now generic, so I hadn't prescribed it because if it was more expensive and brand names that something you can look into.",0,0,0,0
196,"I would yell at Adam at OMOX CTN at to adobo mocks attain atomoxetine, I'll send you the name.",0,0,0,0
197,"
I'll send you that I
don't worry about it.",0,0,0,0
198,"Yeah, I'll send you the name but I'll send you the name of a couple of different ones and then the other one you can, that I was thinking about for you is Lexapro, and they tend to be pretty neutral, it doesn't tend to have it has fewer sexual side effects.",0,0,0,0
199,fewer gi side effects like nausea.,0,0,0,0
200,So we think that that could be a good alternative to so one of those two I hope that helps.,0,0,0,0
201,"So yeah, you can you can talk about that with a therapist but yeah if you decide you want to do that just shoot me my help online message and then tell me what pharmacy to send it to.",0,0,0,0
202,Sure.,0,0,0,0
203,Welcome.,0,0,0,0
204,"Yes, okay.",0,0,0,0
