168,"
Yeah so yeah lets pull up your Echo.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
169,I just let me.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
170,"And by the way, Ill release it to you I sorry I didnt have it doesnt look like its been
released to
you yet,
so you can read the report yourself on my health online.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
171,"Um, but, you know, overall, it looks pretty normal.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
172,"
So good
news.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
173,"
I know, I think we did that because of the leg swelling.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
174,So I just wanted to make sure that it wasnt coming from your heart.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
175,"
But yeah, I mean, basically,
youll see theres what is called diastolic dysfunction is mildly abnormal but otherwise your left ventricle is normal in size the ejection fraction, which is just looking at how your heart pumps that calculated ejection fraction is normal.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
176,Theres no one motion moralities thicknesses normal.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
177,"So yeah so what we see and this is a fairly common finding as you get older, in particularly when youve had a history of hypertension or high blood pressure
your heart can get
a little stiff.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
178,And so thats where it can get a little stiff so its.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
179,"Think of it like a little
bit like an elastic
balloon.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
180,It also needs to it.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
181,"Not only does it pump blood but it needs to relax, so that that the heart can fill with what.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
182,And so what you can get that diastolic dysfunction just means that it gets a little stiff it doesnt relax as well.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
183,"So sometimes I do see some leg swelling so it could be that some of your leg swelling may be related to that its
hard to now have No, its nothing.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
184,Notable again its just some mild.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
185,"What you know mild stiffness of your heart which we expect to see
in someone, someone ages.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
186,So the big thing is just making sure your blood pressure is well controlled.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
187,"
So,
now let me just pull up on this.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
188,"Just give me one minute because
I want to pull up my last
note here
that I had.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
189,"
Yes.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
190,"Oh, you know,
and we saw that on your previous echo.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
191,"You know, so my one thought, so this a few things.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
192,"You know theres a medication that youre currently taking for your blood pressure, we could switch you to a different medication that will actually be better for your heart.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
193,"And its also you know its not going to be, you know, its a generic medication its very you know very well tolerated.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
194,"So, instead of taking nifedipine I would actually recommend you take a medication called metoprolol or topel.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
195,And the good.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
196,"Just like the nifedipine II, its a medication you take once a day.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
197,"So yeah, youre taking that into nifedipine once a day.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
198,"So we would switch
you over.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
199,"
Yeah, great question.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
200,"No, not usually sometimes what the most common side effect I see particularly when we go at the highest doses of medication are is fatigue.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
201,"So, usually we I dont tend to see that until you start getting to like 100 milligrams, but basically I would start you on the lower dose so Im just, just taking a look here at your heart rate and your blood pressure your blood pressure is 126 over 76.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
202,"In October, heart rate was 68, so just let that affect a peanut also slows down heart rate.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
203,My guess and youre on nifedipine 90 milligrams.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
204,"Let me just see here
gonna switch you to the
equivalent dose here.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
205,"Yeah, youre on the highest dose of nifedipine.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
206,"I think we could start you what Im going to do is probably have you titrate up so basically, instead of just like I said instead of nifedipine, youre going to start taking this top roll, and I would recommend taking 50 milligrams once a day.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
207,"Thats right, its going to take the place of nifedipine.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
208,Because you dont need both.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
209,"And if we had to if I had to choose a better drug for you so a drug that is going to help to control your blood pressure, but also control also make your heart happy.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
210,"Remember I said Your heart is a little stiff, its going to help with this.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
211,Its going to help with the stiffness of your heart.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
212,"Thats, thats what tau bra we can basically kill two birds with one stone.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
213,Using the toper all the metoprolol.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
214,Yep.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
215,You got it you dont have to taper off the Philippine or do anything just switch right over.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
216,Okay.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
217,"Now, of course, since we switch your medication what we may see is your blood.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
218,"We, the metoprolol we might need to adjust the dose on the metoprolol.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

461,"So those are, you know, theres obviously more nuanced, you know, places that that starches occur even in some vegetables and things but I think the big places to watch your portion are in those five white foods.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
462,"
So of those five white
things or is there an area, so I heard rice and washing your portion size of rice or what other.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

you could improve.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Sorry I couldnt hear you sounded muffled or what did you say, Yeah,
well,
you know, this is where I would advocate because sometimes it can feel like boiling the ocean.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

468,You know one of the things we did talk about last time was starting to check your blood sugar also after your largest meal.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
469,"So, you know, as I mentioned before, for most people thats, thats the dinner time meal so if, at least as a starting point, you could do one of two things which is, you know, minimizing your portions of the starches youre eating or like you said doing alternatives for the starches, you know, one of the two things but at least you can start to see your blood sugars and get some feedback, you know on it, you know, focusing on your largest meal.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
470,"And is it and and what I will tell you is, if, as your blood sugars are coming down from as youre as youre changing the way you eat for that large meal your fasting blood sugar that one that what youre seeing in the morning will also start to come down.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
471,What do you think about what do you what do you think about that approach.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
472,"
What so what what kept you from checking
your, your blood
sugar after the largest meal
with you.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Okay.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
474,Are you guys eating at home.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

then just focus on the days that youre in Sacramento.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
478,"
How about that.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
479,"I mean,
so is that feasible when you assignment is Im assuming your largest meal is dinner, is that correct.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
480,"Yeah, okay so dinner time.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
481,"So youre mostly doing dinner at home, or actually doesnt really matter because even if you go out to eat, youre you know youre returning home so I guess thats my question for you is it feasible to plan to check.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
482,So you want to check two hours after dinner.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
483,"So lets say you go out to eat at 567 oclock and then you basically want to, you know, gotta want to check some time before before bedtime.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

486,"
Yeah.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

488,"
So maybe we should shoot for that.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

490,"
And.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

what would you like to set a goal for for making
a small
change you feel like you could do now around your around your dinnertime meal.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
492,"And if so, what would that be.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
493,"When are you eating cookies, is it with, Is it for dessert, or is it snacking

who buys the cookies.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
494,"
Okay, got it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
495,"Okay,
so you do the grocery shopping or sometimes sometimes you do the grocery shopping.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
496,"Is there a substitute for the cookies, I guess Im just trying to give you a couple of different ideas because I hear you want to cut down the cookies.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
497,That sounds like a plan you could also think about doing a substitute for the cookies.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
498,"Yeah, absolutely.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
499,"I agree with you, um, you know, the one concern I have though is you know fruits do have their healthy but they do have carbohydrates, or they are you know they have, they will raise your blood sugar, particularly fruits like bananas and oranges tend to.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
500,"So I dont actually think that, you know, banana, or Apple alone is a good substitute for cookies but maybe an apple with peanut butter.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
501,So like half an apple with peanut butter.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
502,So something you generally want to try to get out.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
503,"So this is for a snack you want to try to get a protein in with that carbohydrate, and I actually have a list from the dietitian I can share with you of some snacking alternatives.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
504,"
Some state some tasty snacks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
505,"If youre interested in that, you know, taking a look.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
506,"
Youll be interested.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
507,Okay.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
508,All right.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
509,"So yeah, so I think its an excellent idea i like i like the idea, I like, I like how youre thinking about, you know, you know making some about making a substitute but lets just make sure we make the right substitute.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
510,"So, Yeah.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
511,So that would be.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
512,"So let me, let me just send this over now Im thinking of it cant remember its been a while since Ive sent it out.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
513,"You know its stuff like, you know, peanut butter nuts.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
514,"So there are things that are going to have, theyre going to be filling there, they have protein, then you can pair it pair it with
some
with a carbohydrate.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
515,"Like I said, you know, fruit is healthy but it does have carbs, it does have sugar in it.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
516,"
So let me see.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
517,"
Okay, well I cant find it quickly right now but I will give me a moment.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
518,"So yeah, so, and then just so I understand.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
519,"And then, and then its so, and then in terms of the rice because I hear the race thing coming up.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
520,"You know, like a, like we talked about, you know, a half a cup of rice is, is a serving so it sounds like, if, if I heard you right it sounds like youd like to cut out right you know, stop eating rice every day and just move to every other day.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
521,So I hear you correctly.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
522,Okay.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
523,Okay.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
524,"Yep, and limit to smaller portions.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
525,Okay.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
526,"And then, did I hear you correctly about the cookies so youre going to, youre going to cut out the cookies at least.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
527,"So, you know, eating cut out cookies so that youre only eating cookies maybe twice a week.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
528,"
You like peanut butter okay thats good.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
529,"Yeah, like peanut butter too.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
530,"Its like a little more filling and that salty, sweet is nice.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
531,"And then so I will, you know, thats just one idea that comes off the top of my head, theres a whole list that the dietitian came up with, which is really nice.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
532,"So, I will send that to you include stuff like you know some chocolates and things like that so its you know some salty, sweet, its like some palatable stuff.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
533,"
Yeah.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
534,"No,
I mean the sugar free candies yes I mean its you know its not that, you know, they, it will be sugar free.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
535,"Generally what I counsel patients is if that you do want to get in, get a protein, when youre second you want to get protein in with your snacks and your meals, its going to generally be more filling and it also just sort of helps to when you pair it with a carbohydrate, theyll tend to minimize blood sugar spikes.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
536,So thats the benefit so I mean youre I dont you know with the sugar free candy that thats fine if that helps to quell your craving for sugar.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
537,I think eventually like for really healthy eating youll want to try to substitute for other items.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
538,"Im, Im no dietician So, I mean, at some point if you are interested in talking with the dietitian, you know they can go into a much deeper dive and will have much more nuanced information about food.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
539,"Did we talk about that you know our dietitian hasnt started but if you want I can add you to the waitlist to meet with her when shes, shes shell be starting sometime over the next one to two months.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
540,"
Oh yeah thats right we talked about that last time.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
541,"Yes, I remember now yeah thanks for reminding me You mentioned that we talked about you wanted the flexibility the flexible schedule.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
542,Yeah.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
543,And thats a nice thing because I think we can make that happen.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
544,the dietitian is part of our team so we can be a little more flexible than someone whos like part of a program.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
545,"But I just wanted to get started get you jump started so that you have, you know, something to work on until you meet with the dietician and like I said our previous dietician put together a really nice snack list so Ill send that to you in the after visit summary so after this visit you should get a notification and so you can just open up the visit from today youll see the snack items.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
546,So youll have a substance you know you can think of some alternative substitutes for the cookies.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
547,Perfect.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
548,I like that.,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
